MegaZine3 v2.0.7a (released version with link patch)

The batch files release is 1.8.8.
1.8.8 modified preloader logic: now a version specific preloader is supported. If in folder _custom_files a file bookname_versionname.swf is present, that one will be used
1.8.7 more options tested and some bugs fixed. A bookmark example was built in preparation for a future tutorial. Some more error messages built in
The batch files are commented and most of the supported features had been used and are tested.

No warranty, and in future we'll more likely provide something with a GUI and prgrammed (instead of using batch command files).
But this can take a while... so for the meanwhhile feel free to use and modify to your needs.

The tutorial roughly describes some of the features; it is intended to help you getting your first book fast and give you an example of a working directory structure and megazine.mz3 and index.files.
