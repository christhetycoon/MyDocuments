following &quot;fla&quot; visual is 256K. When it loads, you will see that I
have rendered a figure in many positions in a 3D program, then created masks for
each pose so that you can see behind the figure to objects created in Flash on a
lower layer. Normally, the creation of masks can be time consuming. This
tutorial will explain how to create custom masks quickly to match your rendered
object.)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>What am I talking about?</b> Well... say you want to
create any number of frames from your 3D software and then MASK each frame for
use in Flash over top of some other background...&nbsp; like in the sample
above. (Because of the file size resulting from many bitmaps in a Flash file,
I'd recommend using this on a CD-ROM and not on the web...) <b>Creating masks by
hand </b>gets VERY tiring and time consuming. Trust me. I did it the first time
round. I was not satisfied with the results, so I came up with the following
method...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 1) </b>For this example I used Poser 4, by
MetaCreations. Any 3D software will work as long as you can set your lighting to
custom values. Let me explain: I created one frame, one figure. That's it. Then
I determined 20 coordinates that I wanted the figure to look at when the mouse
is moved around... I chose 20 because it's a small amount and I didn't mind
rendering 20 copies of the figure. </font></p>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 2) </b>Render the figure looking at one of those
points. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 3) </b>HERE IS THE TRICK: Now, before moving the
pose to the next grid location, set your <font color="#800080"><b>ambient
lighting</b></font> to BLACK. In fact, set ALL your lighting to BLACK. All
reflections to OFF. Set your background rendering color to WHITE. When you
render the pose this time, what you will end up with is a solid black image,
like this: (I added the grey border in HTML&nbsp; so you can see what's going
on...)</font></p>
<div align="left">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="120" bgcolor="#C0C0C0" height="320">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Mask1.gif" width="90" height="280"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p><font face="Arial">The solid black image is EXACTLY the same as the 3D shape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 4) </b>Now that you've done say... a whole bunch
of these... here's another trick... if you name your series of bitmaps with
consecutive numbers... like this... &quot;File 001.bmp&quot;, &quot;File
002.bmp&quot;, &quot;File 003.bmp&quot; ... When you import the first file of
your 3D object into the first frame of a new Movie Object, Flash recognizes that
the bitmap is the first in a whole series, and asks you if you want to import
the rest! Say OK. All the rest are imported into consecutive frames in the
timeline. Timesaver! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 5) </b>Create a second layer, above the imported
3D objects, and call it &quot;mask&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 6) </b>Import all the black and white only files
into the layer the same way you imported your 3D artwork into the other layer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 7) </b>Now, click on the first frame of the black
and white only mask of your figure... then select from Flash's Menu &gt; Modify
&gt; Trace Bitmap...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 8) </b>I was impressed with Flash's ability to
accurately trace a bitmap! Once the bitmap has been traced you can keep the
flash trace artwork and delete the bitmap you just traced. Do that for the rest
of the frames of your artwork.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 9) </b>Finally, select the Layer from the Layers
list in Flash and Right Click on it, then select &quot;Mask&quot; to convert all
the artwork in that layer into a mask. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">That's it! You may find Flash's Trace Bitmap... to be not
quite perfect. None of the bitmap tracers I have seen are perfect. Corel has
one. Adobe has one. I have seen other ones... but you always have to do some
final manual tweaking of the mask using the paintbrush and eraser brush directly
on the shape that you traced. Still, this method is MUCH QUICKER than doing it
all by hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And you can create some nice effects with 3D.</font></p>
