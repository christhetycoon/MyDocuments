<h2>Step-by-step</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p >Scroll bars have numerous applications.  They often give a viewer control over what or how they view your movie elements.
By building a generic scroll bar you will master the techniques for this project as well as have a scroll bar that can be
added to your library of objects.  The whole process can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Building the images for the bar and scroller.</li><br>
  <li>Assign the actions to the scroller.</li><br>
  <li>Adding the scroll bar to a movie scene.</li><br>
</ol>
<hr>
<i><b>Background</b></i><br>
<p >A scroll bar in general will have a minimum and maximum value.  These values are part of the overall design of your movie.  
In practice they might represent percentages, or scale factors, or numerical values etc.  What we want
here is a <i><b>generic</b></i> scroll bar so that we can use it for any application we want.  
To do this we will build a scroll bar that returns values from 0 to 1.  In this case the general formula for scrolling will be:<br>
<blockquote><b>movievalue = minimum + scrollvalue * (maximum - minimum)</b></blockquote>
The movievalue would then be used according to your design.  For example it might set the alpha property, or the x/y scale property.</p>

<ol type=1>
<br><br><li>Building the images for the bar and scroller.  
	<p>Keep in mind that whatever it is that you plan to drag (i.e. the scroller) will be a movie clip of a button.  It will be actions
		associated with this button that do most of the work.</p>
	<ol type=a>
		<li>The first step is to build a button to be used as the slider.  For simplicity, just build a simple square button (<b>CTRL + F8</b>).  Give it any name you like and don't worry about the button states.
		<li>Decide how long your slide bar will be.  It can be vertical or horizontal.  It this tutorial I used a vertical bar 200 pixels long and the same width as the slide button.
		<li>Create a new movie clip (<b>CTRL + F8</b>).  Name this clip "SliderMovie".
		<li>Drop an instance of your button into this clip and center it (<b>CTRL + K</b>).
		<li>Double click on the button to open its Instance Properties window and click on the <b>Action Tab</b>.
		<li>Assign the following actions to the button:<br><br>
			On (Press)<br>
      		<span style="margin-left:2%">Start Drag ("", L=0, T=-100, R=0, B=100)</span>
			End On<br>
			On (Release, Release Outside)<br>
      		<span style="margin-left:2%">Stop Drag</span>
			End On<br><br><br>
			Key Points:<br>
			<ol type=i>
				<li>In this tutorial I used a vertical bar so the <b>Left (L)</b> and <b>Right(R)</b> values are 0.
				<li>The bar is going to be 200 pixels long and will be centered so the <b>Top (T)</b> value is -100 and the <b>Bottom (B)</b> is +100.
				<li>You can always rotate the final Scroll Bar 90 degrees if you want a horizontal bar.
			</ol><br><br>
		<li><b>Don't go on until you understand these actions or you will have difficulty with your final scroll bar.</b>	<br><br>
	</ol>
	
<br><br><li>Assigning the actions to the scroller.

	<ol type=a>
		<li>Now create another new movie clip (<b>CTRL + F8</b>).  Name this clip "ScrollBar".
		<li>Using your drawing tools (<b>Rectangle Tool</b>) draw your slider bar 200 pixels heigh and the same width as your button.
		<li>Center the bar (<b>CTRL + K</b>).
		<li>Drop an instance of your "SliderMovie" into this clip and center it horizontally (<b>CTRL + K</b>) and place it vertically where you want it to start.  
		<li>Double click on the "SliderMovie" to open its Instance Properties window and click on the <b>Definitions Tab</b>.
		<li>Make sure its behavior is "Movie Clip" and give it an Instance Name of "Slider".
		<li>Insert an additional keyframe for a total of 2.
		<li>Double click on the keyframe 1 to open its Frame Properties window and click on the <b>Action Tab</b>.
		<li>Assign the following action to this frame:<br><br>
			Set Variable: "scrollvalue" = (100 - slider:_y)/200
			<br><br>
			Key Points:<br>
			<ol type=i>
				<li>The bar I used was 200 pixels high and centered between -100 and +100.
				<li>Scrollvalue will be a number between 0 and 1 depending on the Slider position.
				<li>If your slide moves horizontally, then change _y to _x.
			</ol><br><br>
		<li>Double click on the keyframe 2 to open its Frame Properties window and click on the <b>Action Tab</b>.
		<li>Assign the following action to this frame:<br><br>
			Go to and Play (1)
			<br><br>
	</ol>
<br><br><li>Adding the scroll bar to a movie scene.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>Drop an instance of "ScrollBar" into your scene.
		<li>Double click on the "ScrollBar" to open its Instance Properties window and click on the <b>Definitions Tab</b>.
		<li>Make sure its behavior is "Movie Clip" and give it an Instance Name of "Scroll1".
		<blockquote>The value of the Scroll Bar will be located in "Scroll1:scrollvalue"</blockquote>
		<li>YOU'RE DONE!.  However, to see what you've done we will build a display to see your Scroll Bar in action.
		<ol type=i>
			<li>Using your tools add a textfield to your scene.
			<li>Right click on this text field and give it a variable name of "display".
			<li>Decide on the range of values you want to scroll between and pick a minimum and maximum.
			<li>Double click on the keyframe 1 to open its Frame Properties window and click on the <b>Action Tab</b>.
			<li>Assign the following action to this frame:<br><br>
			Set Variable: "display" = scroll1:scrollvalue
			<br><br>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The main problem you will have in this tutorial is remembering the paths to movie clips and variables.
Try to use names that you will remember and have some association with the movie, instance or variable.</p>
