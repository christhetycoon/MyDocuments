Puyo Puyo Flash Source Edition

==============================

On the Net:  http://www.cruddog.com/puyopuyoflash
System Requirements:  Internet Explorer 4.0 on Win98; other browsers
                      may work, but to a limited extent (Win98 
                      Netscape 4.5 has a minor issue, but otherwise
                      it works too)


Howdy!  Thanks for downloading the source for Puyo Puyo Flash!  The
work put into this is motivated by two things:  to allow the Flash
community to realize the potential of the Flash/Javascript combo, and
to create a kickass Flash game :)  To run this, using your web browser,
open up the file puyo.html.  The source code is a combination of 
puyopuyoflash.fla, settings.fla, and puyopuyo.js.

With Flash 4 almost approaching, a lot of the techniques applied here
will be fully realized without the use of Javascript in the near future.
That's great news, as the implementation of Javascript and Flash is 
also limited by cross-browser compatibility issues -- the example would
be that this runs optimally on a Win98 machine running IE 4.0, but most
other browsers would see anomalies such as the keyboard keys not working,
or the game freezing on the game board transition.

With that in mind, I'm offering the source code as a tribute to Flash 3,
its legacy, and the spark of new things to come with the release of
Flash 4.

One thing I had to remove from this source package were the source files
for the music, as they were much too large to serve over a quick download.
The compiled music for the game is still intact, and will load without the
ugly load bar when run on a local machine.

Another thing that I could not include due to copyright reasons were the
fonts that were used during the creation of the game, so the fonts may
look a bit funny when opening up the source file.

A final word:  you will find that the high score save ability will most 
likely not work, as its retention post-closing the browser is dependent
on this game being in the Puyo Puyo Flash site for this type of 
functionality.  At any rate, this shouldn't disrupt the main enjoyment
of the game.

My hope is that this will provide a good learning experience
for anyone delving into the integration of Flash and Javascript, and to
have fun in doing it, as I know I did :)

Onward Puyo!
