With FlashTracks, you can arrange a drum track using sounds from a standard 5-piece drum set. You can loop the tracks and adjust the tempo. Instructions are included.

Notes:

During playback, the two tracks can sometimes become unsynchronized (one track plays slightly before the other.) This seems to be an issue within Flash, as both of the drum tracks are played inside the same movie clip, so there is no opportunity for the individual tracks themselves to fall out of sync. This seems to happen most during the first playback of the track. Play the track again and it should sync more accurately.

For the abnormally curious: Yes, the drum samples come from a famous drummer's set (except the ride). But I'm not going to tell you who. If you're a real drum connoisseur, you should be able to tell...
