3D Light Button
Created by Ferry Halim

In this fla file, you will find :
- 3D Button.fla (The sample 3D Button source file)
- 3D Button.swf (The generated SWF file)
- Red button.fla (The making of the button. You can see how I created the button. Layer by layer)

How the button works:
Everytime the mouse roll over the Button, the Button will use the Tell Target action to change the Alpha (visibility) of the Light to 100 (making the light visible). When the mouse roll out of the Button, the button will change the Alpha of the Light to 0 (making the light invisible).

Feel free to use, modify, or do anything you want with it.
