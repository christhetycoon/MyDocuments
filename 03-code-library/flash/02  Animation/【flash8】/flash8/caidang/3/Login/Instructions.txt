In this fla file, you will find :
- Login.fla (The sample Logon source file)
- Login.swf (The generated SWF file)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:
in the libary there is a Movie Called 'Movie.Drag me in2 your FLA'
just drag that into your Movie n every thing else will go in.

Now how this FLA works:
FRAME 1.
Edit the Movie n in the first frame it sets the variables.

Set Variable: "thepassword" = "letmein"
Set Variable: "passbox" = ""
Stop

the first variable sets the password for the logon,
the default is "letmein" it can be changed to anything u want,
i.e. "thepassword" = "DogSnot" now your password is DogSnot
the second variable is the box that u type your pass into

FRAME 2.
this frame does all most nothing, all it does is play the
sound if u got your password wrong then returns the frame
1 waiting for your next try.

FRAME 3.
same as FRAME 2 but instead it play the "Access Grained" wave
and goes to FRAME 4 

FRAME 4.
this frame is the members section its slef, put what eva u
want in this frame, theres 2 variables set in the prop.

Set Variable: "passbox" = thepassword
Set Variable: "passstatus" = "Welcome to the members section"
Stop

the first variable just shows the user the current password
the second variable Displays a welcome message, u could change
this to a movie a use the 'Tell Target' command to display 
something more complex.

one last this.

THE LOGON BUTTON

On (Release, Key: <Enter>)
      If (passbox eq thepassword)
            Go to and Play (3)
      Else
            Set Variable: "passstatus" = "Incorrect Password,
                Please Check Your E-M@il For The New Password"
            Play
      End If
End On

this button just compares the text in "passbox" to the variable
"thepassword" and if they r the same it goes to FRAME 3,
if it doesnt it sets the variable "passstatus" = "Incorrect etc"
so it displays the message to the user, then goes to FRAME 2
and does FRAME 2's actions.
