I have been thinking about a 'generated'-flashfile by using txt documents
to variables, thereby leaving it easyer to change the text. The problem
which then will occur is bypassing the difference between very short words
and very long words. And i think it will be too much trouble, since this 
file is not difficult to adapt and also flash3-compatible. In this file 
you will be able to change the letters. Try to 'centre' your word(s)! 
what...? What i mean is.. the effect will start at the letter "E" in the
middle, followed by the letters "S" and "N" and so on. If your word(s) is
smaller then mine, take out the letters which are not used. If your word(s)
are longer, then you will have to change the MoveClip explosie also, it 
will be more complicated but not undoable.
