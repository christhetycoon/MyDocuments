PEAR, the acronym for PHP Extension and Application Repository

Formally defined, PEAR is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components and presently offers more than 400 packages categorized under 37 different topics. Because PEAR contributions are carefully reviewed by the community before they¡¯re accepted, code quality and adherence to PEAR¡¯s standard development guidelines are assured. Furthermore, because many PEAR packages logically implement common tasks guaranteed to repeatedly occur no matter the type of application, taking advantage of this community-driven service will save you countless hours of programming time.
