SOAP Version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It uses XML technologies to define an extensible messaging framework providing a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation-specific semantics.

Keep in mind that SOAP is only responsible for defining the construct used for the exchange of messages; it does not define the protocol used to transport that message, nor does it describe the features or purpose of the Web Service used to send or receive that message. This means that you could conceivably use SOAP over any protocol, and in fact could route a SOAP message over numerous protocols during the course of transmission.
