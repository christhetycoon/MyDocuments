/parten/i 

i 
Perform a case-insensitive search.

g 
Find all occurrences (perform a global search).

m 
Treat a string as several (m for multiple) lines. By default, the ^ and $ characters match at the very start and very end of the string in question. Using the m modifier will allow for ^ and $ to match at the beginning of any line in a string.

s 
Treat a string as a single line, ignoring any newline characters found within; this accomplishes just the opposite of the m modifier.

x 
Ignore white space and comments within the regular expression.

U 
Stop at the first match. Many quantifiers are ¡°greedy¡±; they match the pattern as many times as possible rather than just stop at the first match. You can cause them to be ¡°ungreedy¡± with this modifier.
