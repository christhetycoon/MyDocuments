A transaction is an ordered group of database operations that are perceived as a single unit. A transaction is deemed successful if all operations in the group succeed, and is deemed unsuccessful if even a single operation fails. If all operations complete successfully, that transaction will be committed, and its changes will be made available to all other database processes. If an operation fails, the transaction will be rolled back, and the effects of all operations comprising that transaction will be annulled.

Any changes effected during the course of a transaction will be made solely available to the thread owning that transaction, and will remain so until those changes are indeed committed. This prevents other threads from potentially making use of data that may soon be negated due to a rollback, which would result in a corruption of data integrity.
