Primary Key Indexes

It¡¯s used to uniquely identify each row as a result of the primary key¡¯s own uniqueness. Therefore, the key must be either a value that the entity represented by the row uniquely possesses, or a unique value generated by the database, such as an automatically incrementing integer value. As a result, regardless of whether preexisting rows are subsequently deleted, every row will have a unique primary index.

CREATE TABLE bookmarks (
id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL,
url VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
description MEDIUMTEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(id));
